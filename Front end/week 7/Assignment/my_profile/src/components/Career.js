            <p>
                My career goal is to build a <u>tech business that drives innovation in Africa</u>’s tech industry while also 
                becoming a <u>tech educator</u> to bridge the knowledge gap in technology. Having observed differences in 
                ambition and personal drive across communities, I am passionate about fostering a culture of excellence, 
                ethical leadership, and skill development in the tech space. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Through my business, I aim to provide AI-driven solutions, digital transformation services, and 
                entrepreneurship support to empower 
                African startups and industries. As a tech educator, I aspire to mentor and train the next generation 
                of innovators by developing accessible learning programs, shaping tech curricula, and advocating for 
                increased participation in STEM.        
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By combining business and education, I seek to create a sustainable 
                ecosystem that not only advances Africa’s technological landscape but also nurtures future leaders 
                who will continue to push the boundaries of innovation.
